	<p>The marina in Ibiza Town has hundreds of yachts bobbing in the Mediterranean Sea, with a host of restaurants, boutique shops, trendy bars and a variety of hotels overlooking the boats. Head to Carrer Andenes and you’ll find a row of bars and restaurants that make a great place to enjoy a coffee and soak up the Spanish sun.
    No one is in a hurry here, and you really get a sense of what Ibiza is all about – a playground of the rich and famous.The Old Town (Dalt Vila) is an ancient sandstone fortress, built as a defense against pirates and other invaders. It's one of the best things to do in Ibiza, and walking through the ancient gate into the city is really evocative. The town itself has retained a timeless feel.
    You’ll find some interesting shopping, along with some generations-old bodegas for a refreshing drink and bite to eat. From the top of the hill, you get some great views down to the marina and the newer districts of Ibiza Town.<img src="images/ibi.jpg" alt="Ibiza party" class="immmm"></p>
