    <h1>What you need to know in this challenge time</h1>
    <h3>Self Isolation & Self Quarantine</h3>
    <hr class="sm">
    <p>High-risk states: persons who have arrived in New Mexico from states with a 5% positivity rate or greater over a 7-day rolling average, or a positive test rate greater than 80 per 1 million residents, must physically separate from others in a residence or place of lodging for at least 14 days from the date of their entry into New Mexico or for the duration of their presence in the state, whichever is shorter.
    Lower-risk states: persons arriving from states with a 5% positivity rate or lower over a 7-day rolling average, and a positive test rate lower than 80 per 1 million residents, are not required to self-quarantine. Self-quarantine is still advised for persons arriving from these states, and persons arriving from these lower-risk states are advised to be tested for COVID-19 within 5 to 7 days of their arrival in the state</p>
    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
    <hr class="sm">
    <p>Self-isolating or self-quarantine are the voluntary physical separation of a person or group of people in a residence or other place of lodging. Any person who is self-isolating or self-quarantining may only leave a residence or place of lodging to receive medical care and should not allow others into the residence or place of lodging except for those providing medical care, emergency response, or other individuals designated by the New Mexico Department of Health. Family or household members may visit an isolated or quarantined person, but those visitors are directed to then self-isolate or self-quarantine for a period of no less than 14 days. All persons self-isolating or self-quarantining shall be responsible for all costs associated with the isolation or quarantine.</p>
    <h3>Exemptions</h3>
    <hr class="sm">
    <p>The order’s direction to self-quarantine does not apply to persons employed by airlines; persons performing public safety or public health functions; military personnel and their dependents; federal employees; persons employed by a federal agency or national defense contractor; emergency first responders; health care workers; New Mexico residents who have left the state to obtain medical care; New Mexico residents who have left the state for less than twenty-four hours for matters attendant to parenting responsibilities; minor children who visit or live part-time with a parent residing in a neighboring state; New Mexico residents who attend or work in an elementary, middle, or high school in a neighboring state; non-New Mexico residents who commute into New Mexico to attend or work in an elementary, middle, or high school; persons arriving in the state pursuant to a court order; persons who are employed or contracted by an “essential business,” as defined by the operative public health order addressing mass gathering restrictions and business closures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person who leaves or enters the State for matters unrelated to their employment, military service, medical care, parenting responsibilities, out-of-state parental visitation, education, or court order shall self-quarantine upon arriving or returning to this state.</p>
    <h3>Compliance</h3>
    <hr class="sm">
    <p>Individuals who are quarantined upon arrival into the state from a high-risk state may leave the residence or place of lodging in which they are self-quarantining only for the purposes of medical care. 
    Self-quarantining individuals should not allow others into the residence or place of lodging in which they are quarantined except for those providing medical care, emergency response or other individuals designated by the Department of Health. Family or household members may visit a quarantined person, but those visitors must then self-quarantine themselves for a period of no less than 14 days.
    Non-compliant individuals are subject to involuntary quarantine by the New Mexico Department of Health under the Public Health Emergency Response Act.</p>
